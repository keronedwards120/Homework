Technology can and has significantly changed how we live our lives. It's impact can be seen all facets of society, from electronic toll-booths on our highways to how we shop for vacations and even how we buy toolet paper (hint: on Amazon). Within the financial services we have seen sweeping changing; robo-advisors replacing your former financial advisor at you local bank or investment manager; shopping for your latest vacation online, removing the need to see or call a travel agent. 

Particularly, when it comes to mobile technology, we have seen the greatest change here. it is estimated that over 5 billion people in the world have a mobile phone. As adoption has grown we've seen to companies providing more products and services directly to our mobile phones each year. The Apple Card is yet another product now available to us via our phones. The Apple Card is a credit card developed by Apple Inc., designed primarily to be used with Apple Pay on Apple devices such as an iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, or Mac. It was released in the United States on August 20, 2019, launched through partnership with Goldman Sachs as the issuing bank and Mastercard as the payment network provider. The credit card includes a physical card and the contactless payment version through Appple wallet. You can apply for the card right on your phone through the Wallet app, which is also where all of the Apple Card's spending metrics are displayed. You can also apply for the card right on your phone.

Along with its robust metrics, the Apple Card offers other features that are likely to attract people who are interested in opening a new line of credit, including:
* There are no fees associated with having an Apple Card—specifically, according to Apple, no late fees, no annual fee, no cash-advance fee, 
and no over-the-limit fee
* There is no penalty for a missed payment, late or missed payments will equal additional accrued interest
* Payments can be scheduled from the Wallet app, and when choosing a payment amount users will see how much interest they will accrue based on their remaining balance
* Buying products from Apple (via the Apple Store or App Store) will net 3% cash back, using Apple Pay with the Apple Card will reward 2% cash back, and purchases with the physical card will reward 1% cash back
* Daily Cash is one of the key features that Apple has highlighted. Cash-back rewards are added to a user's Apple Pay balance and can be used for purchases, or to pay down the Apple Card's balance, or to send to other Apple Pay users via iMessage. Cash returns are calculated daily. 
* Real-time fraud protection alerts users whenever an Apple Card transaction occurs, even one they make, allowing the user to okay or block a purchase. 
* If a fraudulent charge is reported, users won't be responsible for paying.
* The physical Apple Card that users get is innovative as well: It's an obvious Apple design—minimal and built of titanium. It doesn't have an expiration date, card number, CVV code, or signature on it, making theft of the card much less of a concern.
* Apple designed the Apple Card to be used almost exclusively with Apple Pay and the Wallet app. The card is only available in the U.S.


## Target market 
Apple currently has an active installed base of devices 1.4 billion in the first quarter, which is an all-time high and growing in each of their geographic segments. Of their 1.4 billion active users, 193 million users are located in the U.S. where the credit card currently available. This gives Apple the opportunity to take advantage of their large captive customer base as every Apple customer is a potential credit card client. Given Apple's significant brand loyalty numbers;
a 2019 survey by SellCell indicates that 90.5% of current Apple users
plan to stick with Apple next time they upgrade; they will benefit from a consistent customer base which they can look to grow their credit card business from.  

The Apple Card is one of the few credit cards that can truly be considered "No-Fee." Cardholders don’t have to pay annual fees, foreign transaction fees or late payment fees, making this card beneficial for consumers who often miss payments or travel abroad. While there are no fees, you can still rack up interest on this card if you don’t pay your bill in full. There is a 12.99% to 23.99% variable APR, based on your creditworthiness. Currently, the average APR for new credit cards 
is 16.91% and that’s expected to drop some as a result of the recent Fed cuts.



## The issue of "Fees"
One primary issues within the credit card industry that the Apple Card address is the issue of high and numerous fees. There are numerous types of fees within the industry: late payment fees, annual fee, cash-advance fee, over-the-limit fee, international transaction fees, etc. Without these various fees, customers have the opportunity to lower the cost of having a credit card. 

In 2016 credit card consumers paid $163 billion in interest and fees, of this amount, $51 billion represented cash advance, annual and late penatly fees. Because the Apple Card does not charge any fees it will help to drive down the cost of having a credit card.   

Unlike many other credit card companies, the Apple Card creators are hoping cardholders take advantage of the card’s financial wellness tools that show users exactly how much it will cost if they carry a balance. What is unique to the Apple Card is the financial wellness feature that can conveniently be accessed via the their apple wallets on their phones. When you make a payment, there’s a simulation wheel with a “payment nudge” that allows you to select a payment amount and see 
how much interest you’d be charged for the given payment. 

You can adjust the “nudge” and see what the interest would be if you made only the minimum payment or any other amount. This feature is user-friendly and represents Apple’s mission to create transparency.

## Privacy and security

The Apple Card’s privacy and security features are some the best amongst credit cards:
* Apple uses advanced security measures to protect cardholders’ privacy. Every transaction you make with the digital Apple Card requires your device number and a one‑time, dynamic security code, which is authorized via Face ID or Touch ID. 
* Purchases made with the physical card are secured with chip technology. And, the physical card has no numbers on it — no card number, security code or expiration date — making it practically impossible for someone to steal your information when you hand your card to pay.
* If an online merchant doesn’t support Apple Pay and you need to enter your card number to complete a purchase, you can access that information through the Wallet app. If you misplace your card, you have the option to freeze it and request a replacement directly from the 
Wallet app.
* The Apple Card is built on Apple's IOS technology platform. The main features of Apple Card are built into the iPhone itself, but they spread beyond the Wallet app. Rewards are delivered on the Apple Cash card, and customer support is handled through iMessage. 


## Market landscape
Credit card debt was $870 billion at the end of 2018 per the federal reserve with over 480 million credit cards in circulation. With ~330 million people in the U.S. This is equivalent to 1.5 credit cards on average per citizen. The average U.S. credit card consurmer has ~$6,000 in debt outstanding and utilizes 30% of their available credit. With 67% of the U.S. population owning a credit card and Apple having 193 million active U.S. iPhone users, this representing an interesting cross-section the Apple Card can get a significant foothold in the U.S. credit card market.

While Apple is one of the first credit cards offered by a technology company and has little competition in this specific sector besides the BarclaysUber Card, created through a partnership with Uber Technologies and Barclays Bank. It does still operate in the billing and payments industry which is still a growing industry. Over the past 10-15 years companies and products like Paypal/Venmo, Square/CashApp, Google Pay, Apple Pay, Zelle have had success. Though, besides Paypal have suffered from low adoption rates. Venmo, Square Cash, Google Pay and Apple Pay still suffer from a less than 10% adoption rate in the U.S. While traditional credit and debit adoption rates are 80% and 79% respectively. With the Apple Card being a traditional credit card that primarily used on a mobile device the overall adoption should be higher that the other tech platforms. 


## Results
Since the Apple Card is relatively new and launch in August 2019, there is little to no data on how successful the adoption of the card has been thus far. Howevere the buzz around the card has been significant and should result in large number of application in the first few years. Once the following financial data becomes available, the market will be able to judge how successful the card is: 
* Number of applicants
* Utilizations
* Interest income
* Deliquency rate


## Recommendations
The Apple Card represents a great intersection of finance and technology
spending color coded tracking allows you to be more mindful of your spending so you can budget better. An area where Apple can add complementary products to the Apple Card is offering other banking products as well. Such as, checking and savings accounts. In addition, offering a debit card that can be paired with the Apple Card and uses the same physical card and be completely managed from the customers phone. This will help to minimize the number of cards a consumer has to carry in their wallet and give them greater insight, security, and privacy over their financial lives, which can lead to better decision making.
